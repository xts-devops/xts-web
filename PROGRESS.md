**Did:** Added the Codex/Claude coordination files: `AGENTS.md` (shared rules, lanes,
verify gate), `CLAUDE.md` (imports AGENTS.md + Claude lane), `HANDOVER.md` (project
reference), `TASKS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, this file.
**Why:** so Codex and Claude can work on the repo in parallel without file clashes,
and either can pick up cold.
**Verify:** docs only, no code changed.
**Next:** User merges PR #2 and PR #3, then this PR. Codex: start with a backend bug
task from `TASKS.md` (unread markers on dotted emails is small and self-contained).
Supabase work waits for the design doc, which waits on the user's downtime answer.
Open PRs at the time of writing: #2 (env names), #3 (local preview).
